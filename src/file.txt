Final Thoughts on UX Flow:
Keep the flow simple and intuitive: Your goal is to minimize friction so that users can add and track habits quickly and easily.

Ensure that adding/editing a habit is clear and involves minimal steps. You can allow users to set more options (like reminders and goals), but the basic flow should always be straightforward.

Incorporate progress feedback: Showing users how they're doing in a simple but visually appealing way (charts, streaks) motivates them to stay consistent.

Consider onboarding tips if you want to guide new users on how to use the app in their first few sessions.
